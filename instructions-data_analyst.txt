Last month's campaign results are in the attached data file.  In the file, you will also find 3 flag fields that signal fraudulent activity.  Specifically,

10% of website conversions with a Flag_1 = 1 will be returned
20% of website conversions with a Flag_2 = 1 will be returned
30% of website conversions with a Flag_3 = 1 will be returned

Assume that the return probability from flags is additive.  Thus, a website with Flag_1 and Flag_3 has a 40% chance of their conversions being returned.

She would like a report(excel or text file) that has the following fields, Website_id and Score.  Score is your custom calculation to show which websites are good or bad at producing conversions.  The report data should be sorted by the Score field descending with the best performing websites on top.

Also, Madeline would like 2 things from you:
(1) Which 3 websites do you think will perform the best next month? 
(2) Is there a correlation between Clicks and Flag_1 that is significant?

Please include SQL statements, correlation details, and any other information to support your response.
